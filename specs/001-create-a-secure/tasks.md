# Tasks: Secure CLI Password Manager

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-create-a-secure/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → If not found: ERROR "No implementation plan found"
   → Extract: tech stack, libraries, structure
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract entities → model tasks
   → contracts/: Each file → contract test task
   → research.md: Extract decisions → setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project init, dependencies, linting
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests
   → Core: models, services, CLI commands
   → Integration: DB, middleware, logging
   → Polish: unit tests, performance, docs
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All contracts have tests?
   → All entities have models?
   → All CLI commands implemented?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- Paths shown below follow single project structure per plan.md

## Dependencies
- **Setup before all**: T001-T003 must complete before any other tasks
- **Tests before implementation**: T004-T020 before T021-T046
- **Models before services**: T021-T024 before T025-T031
- **Services before CLI**: T025-T031 before T032-T043
- **Core before integration**: T021-T042 before T043-T046
- **Implementation before polish**: T021-T046 before T047-T060

## Parallel Example
```bash
# Phase 3.2 - Launch all contract tests together:
Task: "CLI contract test for init command in tests/contract/test_cli_init.py"
Task: "CLI contract test for auth command in tests/contract/test_cli_auth.py" 
Task: "CLI contract test for add command in tests/contract/test_cli_add.py"
Task: "CLI contract test for get command in tests/contract/test_cli_get.py"
Task: "Security contract test for master password operations in tests/contract/test_security_master.py"

# Phase 3.3 - Launch all model creation together:
Task: "PasswordEntry model in src/models/password_entry.py"
Task: "MasterCredential model in src/models/master_credential.py"
Task: "Session model in src/models/session.py"
Task: "DatabaseMetadata model in src/models/database_metadata.py"

# Phase 3.5 - Launch all unit tests together:
Task: "Unit tests for password entry validation in tests/unit/test_password_entry.py"
Task: "Unit tests for encryption/decryption in tests/unit/test_encryption.py"
Task: "Unit tests for key derivation in tests/unit/test_key_derivation.py"
```

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- Verify all tests fail before implementing (RED phase of TDD)
- Commit after each task completion
- Focus on security: use secure random generation, proper key derivation, constant-time comparisons
- Follow contracts exactly for input/output formats
- Test on multiple platforms during T059

## Task Generation Rules
*Applied during main() execution*

1. **From CLI Interface Contract**:
   - Each command (init, auth, add, get, list, update, delete, generate) → contract test task [P]
   - Each command → CLI implementation task [P]
   
2. **From Security Interface Contract**:
   - Each security operation → contract test task [P]
   - Each security operation → service implementation task [P]
   
3. **From Data Model**:
   - Each entity (PasswordEntry, MasterCredential, Session, DatabaseMetadata) → model creation task [P]
   - Database operations → service layer tasks (sequential due to shared DB)
   
4. **From QuickStart Scenarios**:
   - Each user flow → integration test [P]
   - Complete workflow → validation task

5. **Ordering Rules Applied**:
   - Setup → Tests → Models → Services → CLI → Integration → Polish
   - Tests must fail before implementation (TDD requirement)
   - Dependencies prevent some parallel execution
