# Feature Specification: Secure CLI Password Manager

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-a-secure`  
**Created**: 2025-09-11  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create a secure, minimalist Python CLI password manager that follows the Unix philosophy of doing one thing well. Use SQLite as the database backend with proper encryption for stored passwords (AES-256 or similar). The application should focus exclusively on core password management functions: add, retrieve, update, and delete passwords with a master password authentication system. Implement security best practices including password hashing with salt, secure memory handling, and database encryption. Build an attractive, user-friendly CLI interface using a Python library like Rich, Textual, or Click for enhanced visual appeal with colors, tables, and clear formatting. Design it to be both intuitive with clear prompts and help text, and scriptable for integration with other Unix tools. Include comprehensive documentation in the README covering installation, usage examples, security implementation details, and troubleshooting."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a command-line user who needs to manage multiple passwords securely, I want a simple tool that allows me to store, retrieve, update, and delete passwords protected by a master password, so that I can maintain strong, unique passwords for all my accounts without memorizing them.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the user has not authenticated, **When** they attempt to access any password operation, **Then** the system prompts for master password authentication
2. **Given** the user is authenticated, **When** they add a new password entry with a label and credentials, **Then** the system securely stores the entry and confirms success
3. **Given** the user is authenticated and has stored passwords, **When** they search for a password by label, **Then** the system displays the matching credentials
4. **Given** the user is authenticated, **When** they request to update an existing password entry, **Then** the system updates the entry and confirms the change
5. **Given** the user is authenticated, **When** they delete a password entry, **Then** the system removes it permanently after confirmation
6. **Given** the user is running the tool in a shell script, **When** they provide appropriate flags/options, **Then** the tool outputs in a machine-readable format suitable for piping

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the user forgets the master password? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: password recovery mechanism not specified]
- How does system handle concurrent access to the password database from multiple terminals?
- What occurs when the password database becomes corrupted?
- How are duplicate labels/entries handled?
- What happens when the session times out? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: session timeout duration not specified]
- How does the system behave when the database reaches size limits? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: storage limits not specified]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST authenticate users with a master password before allowing any password operations
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to add new password entries with a unique label and associated credentials
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow users to retrieve stored passwords by searching with labels or partial matches
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow users to update existing password entries
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow users to delete password entries with confirmation
- **FR-006**: System MUST encrypt all stored passwords using industry-standard encryption
- **FR-007**: System MUST hash the master password with salt for authentication
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide clear visual feedback for all operations (success, failure, warnings)
- **FR-009**: System MUST display help text and usage instructions when requested
- **FR-010**: System MUST support scriptable output format for integration with other tools
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle all password data securely in memory
- **FR-012**: System MUST validate password entry labels for uniqueness [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: behavior when duplicate labels - reject or allow?]
- **FR-013**: System MUST lock or timeout after [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: inactivity period not specified]
- **FR-014**: System MUST support password generation [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: password generation requirements not specified - length, complexity rules?]
- **FR-015**: System MUST handle backup and restore operations [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: backup strategy not specified]
- **FR-016**: System MUST support search operations with partial matching
- **FR-017**: System MUST confirm destructive operations (delete, overwrite)
- **FR-018**: System MUST provide comprehensive documentation including installation, usage, and troubleshooting

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Password Entry**: Represents a stored password record with a unique label, encrypted credentials (username/password), creation timestamp, last modified timestamp, and optional metadata (URL, notes)
- **Master Credential**: Represents the user's master password used for authentication and database encryption key derivation
- **Session**: Represents an authenticated user session with timeout management
- **Database**: Represents the encrypted storage container for all password entries
