# Feature Specification: Fix and Secure 15-Minute Authentication Session

**Feature Branch**: `002-the-auth-feature`  
**Created**: 2025-01-12  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "the auth feature to stay authenticated for 15 mins to the database doesn't work. Please implement this in a secure way where we won't get haxed pls"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a password manager user, I want to authenticate once with my master password and remain authenticated for 15 minutes of activity, so that I don't need to repeatedly enter my master password during active use while maintaining security.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has successfully authenticated with their master password, **When** they perform any password manager operation within 15 minutes, **Then** the operation executes without requiring re-authentication
2. **Given** a user has been authenticated for 14 minutes and 59 seconds, **When** they perform an operation, **Then** the session extends for another 15 minutes from that action
3. **Given** a user has been idle for 15 minutes, **When** they attempt any password manager operation, **Then** they are prompted to re-authenticate with their master password
4. **Given** an authenticated session exists, **When** the user explicitly locks or logs out, **Then** the session immediately terminates regardless of remaining time
5. **Given** the application crashes or is forcefully terminated, **When** the user restarts the application, **Then** they must re-authenticate (no persistent sessions)

### Edge Cases
- What happens when system time changes during an active session?
- How does system handle multiple concurrent sessions (if user opens app twice)?
- What occurs if the session token/identifier is compromised?
- How does the system behave during system sleep/hibernate?
- What happens if user changes their master password during an active session?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST authenticate users with their master password before granting access to stored passwords
- **FR-002**: System MUST maintain an authenticated session for exactly 15 minutes from the last user activity
- **FR-003**: System MUST automatically extend the session timeout with each user action (rolling timeout)
- **FR-004**: System MUST immediately terminate the session when user explicitly locks or logs out
- **FR-005**: System MUST require re-authentication after session expires
- **FR-006**: System MUST NOT persist authentication across application restarts
- **FR-007**: System MUST protect session data from unauthorized access by other processes or users
- **FR-008**: System MUST invalidate all active sessions when master password is changed
- **FR-009**: System MUST log authentication events (login, logout, timeout) for security auditing
- **FR-010**: System MUST clear sensitive session data from memory when session ends
- **FR-011**: Session timeout MUST be [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: should timeout be configurable by user or fixed at 15 minutes?]
- **FR-012**: System MUST handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: behavior during system sleep/hibernate - pause timer or continue?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Authentication Session**: Represents an active user session with timestamp of last activity, session identifier, and authentication status
- **Session Activity**: Records of user actions that reset the timeout timer
- **Authentication Event**: Security audit log entries for login attempts, logouts, and timeout events
